# RAG-based_Chatbot_For_Uni_Addmission
This project implements a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot. It leverages locally run Ollama models (Qwen2.5-7B for generation, BGE-M3 for embeddings) to answer questions based on information extracted from a PDF document. The interface is built with Streamlit.
